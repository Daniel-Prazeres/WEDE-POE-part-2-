        <!-- Company description -->
        <p>
            Dead Pixels&trade; was formed on the 10/8/2024 with the express purpose of giving gamers<br>
            unique experiences that focused on societal issues that most bigger studios<br>
            wouldnt tackle. Each game is lovingly crafted by our indie dev team designed to<br>
            make you both feel enjoyment and facinated. We hope our games can inspire the<br>
            hearts of gamers to do more outside just playing games. Secondly a 35% of sales<br>
            revenue will be donated to charity with the rest being re-invested into the<br>
            company to pay employees and hopefully make better and better games.
